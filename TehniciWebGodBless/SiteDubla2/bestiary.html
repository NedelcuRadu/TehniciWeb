            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Fleders -</h3> Lesser vampires, but this description can be deceiving, for lesser does not mean weak and stupid. True, they are primitive and bear a closer relation to animals than to humans; but when they drop on their prey from above, they can be just as dangerous as their noble cousins, even to a <div class="tooltip">witcher<span class="tooltiptext"> Someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical conditioning, and mysterious rituals (which take place at "witcher schools" such as Kaer Morhen) in preparation for becoming an itinerant monsterslayer for hire.</span></div>.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Fiend -</h3> A relict creature, the beast likely resembles a deer but its size resembles more a barn. Fiends also have a third eye which they use to hypnotize its opponents. Fiends are walking mountains of muscle capped with horned, tooth-filled heads. When possible they avoid humans, but when not possible, they kill them, and without much difficulty. </figcaption>

            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Shaelmaar -</h3> Is a large creature that spends most of its life underground in burrow tunnels leaving only at times. Completly blind, it relies on echolocation, a mechanism based on how sound waves bounce off potential obstacles, not unlike bats.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Cyclop -</h3> Cyclopses can easily be recognized by the single eye located in the center of their foreheads. If for some reason that is not visible, other tell-tale signs are their enormous size, incredible strength and a seething hatred for all humans.</figcaption>

In many ways, alps are similar to two other species of intelligent vampires, mulas and bruxae, although seemingly less powerful than the latter.</figcaption>

            </a>
            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Griffin -</h3> The griffin looks like a combination of a ferocious cat and a giant bird. It usually inhabits primeval highlands and builds its nests on unreachable mountain summits. The griffin preys on large mammals and, being a highly territorial creature, fiercely defends its hunting grounds. Griffins are tough opponents and their strength should not be underestimated.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Scurver -</h3> The bodies of these hideous, vaguely humanoid creatures are covered with scraps of flesh, under which lurk rotten muscles stretched around a strong, flexible skeleton. Scurvers, which feed on old, rotting corpses, prefer to make their hunting grounds in abandoned torture sites and forgotten graveyards.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Bruxa -</h3> A very powerful type of vampire that takes on the appearance of a dark-haired, young human, most often woman, but whose natural form is that of a large, black bat with sharp fangs and claws. It is one of few vampire species not affected by sun, the others being alps, mulas and <div class="tooltip">Higher Vampire<span class="tooltiptext">True higher vampires can look exactly like a human being and can even evade detection from a witcher's medallion, only revealing themselves at their own convenience. Higher vampires are also incredibly intelligent, and possess numerous - and often individual - abilities. Unlike their lesser cousins, higher vampires do not need to drink blood to survive; however, the consumption of blood offers an experience not unlike the consumption of alcohol.</span></div>.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>
                <h3>- Werewolf -</h3> Werewolves are therianthropes who transform into wolves or half-wolves. As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but very vulnerable to silver. Werewolves have a legendary sense of smell, exceptional even amongst real wolves. Lycanthropes are usually on good terms with other canines and, as one would expect, hate werecats.</figcaption>
