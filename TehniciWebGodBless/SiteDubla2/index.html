            <figcaption><div class="tooltip">EXPLORATION<span class="tooltiptext"> The world of The Witcher beckons to be explored -- just pick a point on the horizon and venture off into the unknown. You’ll have your trusty horse to call on whenever you need. Load it with trophies taken from the massive beasts you hunt down or gallop it into combat to crush those standing in your way. You’ll also go where no horse can follow, descending deep into sprawling caves, diving beneath the waves to gather sea herbs and search forgotten shipwrecks for long-lost treasure. You’ll sail your boat through storms, navigate past hostile sea monsters and along craggy, dangerous shores pounded by waves. This land is rich in mystery and adventure -- traverse it any way you like.</span></div></figcaption>

            <figcaption><div class="tooltip">INHABITANTS<span class="tooltiptext"> This world is lively and full of color, home to a broad mix of races, nations and social classes -- everything from filth-covered elven beggars to the wealthiest of kings. As an outcast bounty hunter, you mix in all these circles, yet belong to none. In your search for information you’ll make unsavory deals with criminals, attend balls with the high-born and listen to the heart-wrenching tales of war refugees. All around you will see signs of gross injustice, wartime atrocities and more -- but it’s always up to you to either help or shrug and let the fires rage. The Continent is also a living, wild world: you’ll interact with animals both hostile and benign and witness a true ecosystem with natural checks and balances in action. And in this system, you’ll be the apex predator. Clear out the monsters infesting a region, or eradicate a nest to rid an area of the foul beasts it spawns, and watch residents return to rebuild their lives. In The Witcher, the world lives alongside you and resonates with your every action.</span></div></figcaption>

As you traverse distinct regions, you’ll feel and see the world change. You’ll hear the change on people’s lips, too: in Skellige battle-hardened marauders will shout boasts of their latest raids, in Novigrad rich and poor will gossip about executions and houses of pleasure, while in No Man’s Land, villagers will pray in hushed whispers to dark, ancient gods.</span></div></figcaption>

Take a break from monster hunting just to join in the fun or to win some coin to further your goals. In a new twist to evenings by the fire, try your hand at gwent, a deep and rewarding game-within-a-game. Invented by dwarves and played for fun or money, this simple yet addictive pastime will have you sitting down for match after match and constantly thinking about how to bolster your deck.</span></div></figcaption>

Witcher’s Signs, another set of skills in Geralt’s repertoire, are powerful combat spells that take various forms, from protective barriers, through torrents of flame, to magic snares and more. Lastly there is Geralt’s wolf medallion, the symbol of his witcher school. This pendant hums to alert him of nearby magic and monsters -- invaluable help to a monster hunter. Most of these skills can be developed for additional effects and increased potency, making Geralt an even more fearsome fighter.</span></div></figcaption>

From swords and axes to crossbows and unique gear available only from the finest crafters, the tools of Geralt’s trade allow him to deal death in many ways. The wide variety of armor available to Geralt absorbs both physical and magical attacks, thereby delaying the witcher’s own demise, while potent blade oils and bombs give him an extra edge in combat. Thanks to his training in alchemy, Geralt can gather rare herbs along his path and use them to brew special, highly toxic concoctions. His potions would kill any ordinary human, but Geralt’s mutations let him metabolize them. They grant him abilities that include seeing in the dark, moving faster, striking with added force… and much, much more.</span></div></figcaption>

            <figcaption><div class="tooltip">MONSTER HUNTS<span class="tooltiptext"> Geralt is a bounty hunter, an apex predator in a world gone wrong. In a monster-infested world he is a necessary counter-balance. His main task is to eliminate creatures that pose a threat to society. Hunting
monsters is his business -- and there’s always plenty of work. Monsters
come in all shapes and sizes, and while some are members of broader
species, others are one -of-a-kind. To face the latter, extremely
powerful or clever creatures, you’ll embark on special quests to learn
about their fighting style and behavior.

The monster threat is real and strong. Along your path you’ll encounter
entire areas overrun by beasts, the humans and nonhumans who once lived
there gone. Should you decide to risk death, your job will be to
exterminate every last pest and render these places safe once more.
Succeed and you’ll see folk return, more than eager to craft and sell
you rare, enhanced gear.</span></div></figcaption>

Geralt is a professional, and if it helps get the job done, he’ll accept the aid of scoundrels and brutes, as well as sorceresses and jolly dwarves. In his line of work, he can also become a target. Those with different agendas send their spies, assassins, murderers and thugs after him. Since the forces of order generally don’t like witchers, you won’t be able to count on guards or soldiers coming to your aid. You’re on your own -- and in for a tough fight.</span></div></figcaption>

            <h2>Origin Of The Story: Witcher Saga</h2>
            <p>The stories are set on an unnamed Continent, which was settled several thousand years earlier by elves from overseas. When they arrived, the elves encountered gnomes and dwarves. After a period of war between the elves and dwarves, the dwarves retreated into the mountains and the elves settled in the plains and forests. Human colonists arrived about five hundred years before the events in the stories, igniting a series of wars. The humans were victorious, and became dominant; the non-human races, now considered second-class citizens, often live in small ghettos within human settlements. Those not confined to the ghettos live in wilderness regions not yet claimed by humans. Other races on the Continent are halflings and dryads; werewolves and vampires appeared after a magical event, known as the Conjunction of the Spheres. During the centuries preceding the stories, most of the Continent's southern regions have been taken over by the Nilfgaard Empire; the north belongs to the fragmented Northern Kingdoms. The Witcher saga takes place in the aftermath of the first major war between the Nilfgaard Empire and the Northern Kingdoms, with a second war beginning in the middle of the series.</p>
