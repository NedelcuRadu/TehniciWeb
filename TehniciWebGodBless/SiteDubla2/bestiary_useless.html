                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Fleders -</h3> Lesser vampires, but this description can be deceiving, for lesser does not mean weak and stupid. True, they are primitive and bear a closer relation to animals than to humans; but when they drop on their prey from above, they can be just as dangerous as their noble cousins, even to a witcher.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Fiend -</h3> A relict creature, the beast likely resembles a deer but its size resembles more a barn. Fiends also have a third eye which they use to hypnotize its opponents. Fiends are walking mountains of muscle capped with horned, tooth-filled heads. When possible they avoid humans, but when not possible, they kill them, and without much difficulty. </figcaption>

                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Cyclop -</h3> Cyclopses can easily be recognized by the single eye located in the center of their foreheads. If for some reason that is not visible, other tell-tale signs are their enormous size, incredible strength and a seething hatred for all humans.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Shaelmaar -</h3>  Is a large creature that spends most of its life underground in burrow tunnels leaving only at times. Completly blind, it relies on echolocation, a mechanism based on how sound waves bounce off potential obstacles, not unlike bats.</figcaption>

                    <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Alp" target="_blank">

                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Alp -</h3> Members of a vampiric race which inhabits the lands of the Northern Kingdoms since the Conjunction of the Spheres, they can put targets to sleep by injecting a somniferous substance causing nightmares. In many ways, alps are similar to two other species of intelligent vampires, mulas and bruxae, although seemingly less powerful than the latter.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Griffin -</h3> The griffin looks like a combination of a ferocious cat and a giant bird. It usually inhabits primeval highlands and builds its nests on unreachable mountain summits. The griffin preys on large mammals and, being a highly territorial creature, fiercely defends its hunting grounds. Griffins are tough opponents and their strength should not be underestimated.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Scurver -</h3> The bodies of these hideous, vaguely humanoid creatures are covered with scraps of flesh, under which lurk rotten muscles stretched around a strong, flexible skeleton. Scurvers, which feed on old, rotting corpses, prefer to make their hunting grounds in abandoned torture sites and forgotten graveyards.</figcaption>

                    </a>
                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Bruxa -</h3> A very powerful type of vampire that takes on the appearance of a dark-haired, young human, most often woman, but whose natural form is that of a large, black bat with sharp fangs and claws. It is one of few vampire species not affected by sun, the others being alps, mulas and Higher Vampires.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>
                        <h3>- Werewolf -</h3> Werewolves are therianthropes who transform into wolves or half-wolves. As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but very vulnerable to silver. Werewolves have a legendary sense of smell, exceptional even amongst real wolves. Lycanthropes are usually on good terms with other canines and, as one would expect, hate werecats.</figcaption>
